# meal-debit-system-2019
 
A group assignment which being assigned at the last semester of Diploma, which is an assessment similar to the Final Year Project (FYP) from Degree as the course required us to submit a full progress report every week on our system. The assessment required an abundance of documentation to record down every single element of the system, which is a horrendous task that forced our hands at the beginning of the final semester. In this assignment we chose to do a website that focused on handling meal transaction within the school environment. By implementing the website with the additional skill that I've learned such as AJAX, it made the overall system improved a lot compared to the Reise Web-Portal project which has been done in 2018. The website also equipped with a higher level of SQL knowledge as well and making the server process even more fluent. Bootstrap 4 was also being learned from this assessment as well, and making the overall system looks even more professional.
