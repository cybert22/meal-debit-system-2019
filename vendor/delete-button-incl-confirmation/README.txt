A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/edanny/pen/XNEweg.

 A slick, simple delete (incl. confirm) button animation. Inspired by (or more brutally borrowed from) Adam Whitcroft's Dribbble: https://dribbble.com/shots/969445-The-Double-Delete

The animation as I envisioned the Dribbble to work. I also added the blue for the 'confirm state', in stead of the original green.
